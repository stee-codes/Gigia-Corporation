      </h6>
      <h4>5. Termination</h4>
      <h6>
        You may terminate your agreement and close your account with Gigia at any time, effective the last day of your subscription term, by sending an email to support@Gigia.com. Gigia may terminate its relationship with you, or may terminate or suspend the accessibility to the Website, Products, and/or Services at any time, including the use of any software, (i) if you breach these Terms and/or any other agreement with Gigia; (ii) if Gigia reasonably suspects that you are using the Website, Products, and/or Services to breach the law or infringe third party rights; (iii) if Gigia reasonably suspects that you are trying to unfairly exploit or misuse Gigia’s policies; (iv) if Gigia reasonably suspects that you are using the Website, Products, and/or Services fraudulently, or that Products or Services provided to you are being used by a third party fraudulently; (v) if you fail to pay any amounts due to Gigia; (vi) you violate any applicable law or regulation. Upon termination of your Gigia account for the above reasons, there will be no refund of fees and you will be denied access to the Website, Products and/or the Services, including all of its data.
        Gigia may terminate any agreement and access to your account, if the Services or any part thereof, are no longer legally available in your jurisdiction, or are no longer commercially viable, at Gigia’s sole discretion. In case of termination or closing of your account by you because of a material breach by Gigia, without any default by you, or in case of a force majeure on the side of Gigia, Gigia will refund pro rata for the remaining period of your subscription any fees or expenses paid by you.
        If you believe that Gigia has failed to perform or the Services are defective, you must notify Gigia in writing and allow fourteen (14) days for Gigia to cure the defect. If Gigia cures the defect within this cure period, Gigia will not be in default and cannot be held liable for any damages and/or losses in connection to such default. If Gigia has not cured the defect within this cure period, you may terminate the subscription with immediate effect, upon written notice to Gigia.
      </h6>

        You understand and agree that, by using the Products and/or Services, you are solely responsible for any data, including personally identifiable information, collected or processed via our Products and/or Services.
